# quote-generator-2
I built this fun project during my spare time to play around and experiment with DOM manipulation and API calls with JavaScript.
Feel free to clone and make changes to the project if you desire to.
The Project uses a Twitter API that allows users to post quotes from the quote website directly to their Twitter accounts. How cool :)
